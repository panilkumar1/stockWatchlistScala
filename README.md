# Watchlist for Stocks


## Running the application locally

Open the project in IntelliJ and Run the application as Play Framework. Go to http://localhost:9000
There seems to be version compatibility issues with Scala, Play and SBT, so I couldn't run this in terminal.

## Features
- NO Persistence. Watchlist data is lost upon restart.
- Enter valid Symbols only
- Stocks data is refereshed every 5 seconds
